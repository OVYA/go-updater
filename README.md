# A Bash Script to Install/Update Go

The script [go-update.sh](./go-update.sh) automatically install or update the
latest [Go](https://go.dev/) environment.

If some cli have been previously installed using `go install`, they also will be
automatically updated thanks to [gup](github.com/nao1215/gup).
